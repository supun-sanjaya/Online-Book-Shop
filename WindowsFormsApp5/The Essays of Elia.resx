    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>father survived but a few montlis; a sister of his who had formed one of the family died about the same
 time. Thus Charles and Mary, who had meantime recovered her reason, were left practically alone in 
the world; for their brother John held aloof, desiring that Mary should remain in the asylum. Charles had had 
an attack of insanity in the winter of 1795-6; it was, perhaps, in consequence of this, and the care of his sister,
 that he gave up the idea of marrying the Anna of his sonnets. He had no return of the madness, bui Mary had
 frequent relapses, the approach of which she felt in time to enable her to retire to the lunatic asylum. It was in
 1796 that Lamb first appeared as an author, when four sonnets by him were published in a volume of Coleridge
 spoems. Lamb's sfirst attempt in prose, exclusive of letters, was the tale of Rosamund Gray (1798), incongruous
 and improbable, showing the authors weakness in narrative, but exhibiting the pathos, quaintness of description
 and appropriateness of quotation which form the excellence of the Essays of Elia. Of it Shelley wrote: "What a lovely
 thing is his Rosamund Gray! How much knowledge of the sweetest and deepest part of our nature is in it!" In the same
 year he wrote what is perhaps the best known of his poems, the first stanza of which he afterwards omitted - "Where are
 they gone, the old familiar faces? I had a mother, but she died and left me - Died prematurely in a day of horrors - All, all
 are gone, the old familiar faces." For the first seventeen years of the present century, Charles and Mary Lamb resided within
 the precincts of the Temple; first in Mitre Court Buildings, then in Inner Temple Lane. At the beginning of this period, Charles
 was employed as an occasional writer of trifles for newspapers, but he soon attempted more ambitious work. Rosamund Gray
 had shown that he was defective in the qualities which</value>
